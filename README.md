# Smart Car IoT Project

# Introduction

Welcome to our Smart Car IoT project repository! This project aims to provide an educational exploration of applied IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, focusing on microcontrollers such as Arduino and ESP32. By leveraging various sensors and connectivity options, we endeavor to create smart gadgets that can make measurements, send data to the internet, and be controlled remotely.

In this project, we specifically delve into the development of a smart car prototype. This smart car incorporates sensors for control, measurements, and data transmission capabilities to the internet. By utilizing both Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers, we can harness their distinct capabilities to enhance the functionality of our smart car.
